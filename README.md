Congratuations! You actually opened me, good for you!
Here's the library's documentations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaPCtmgFJXqFyS40LDxkDq4oyzprftFgylym-faExAo/edit?usp=sharing

Notes on the updates so far:
---
  + Added a bunch of functions
  + Added a special demo code that demos everything (execute.py)
  + Added README


Instruction on how to use:
---
Basically treat it as a normal library. for any help on functions or just to see what they are, check the documentation of MCpen (link is up there). In order for this to function and
work properly, you have to use the MCPI library, installed by using "pip install mcpi" (no quotes). For this to work, you will need to be on a server with the correct plugin, with 
your Minecraft version at 1.11.2 (yes the .2 matters).
To set up your server, goto this link and you are basically good: https://codingmindsacademy.com/mc.html

Stuff to look out for:
---
  - Pen will not store +NBT data of blocks, even with pen up (for now)
  - The draw line function will sometimes be janky and the line wont look perfectly straight. (It's Minecraft)
  - Try not to over speed the pen, as you won't see it go anywhere and possibly destroy some of your builds if you are not careful.
  - If there is something wrong immediatly pause or kill the program in your IDE or your TERMINAL, not minecraft chat


Installation:
---
To get this thing on your computer, simply type: "pip install MCpen" (without the quotes)
